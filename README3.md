## 🧠 About

**Bypass LockDown Browser** is a cross-language simulation tool that mimics the behavior of bypass software used to override restrictions from proctoring applications like Respondus LockDown Browser. It includes mock features such as:

- Webcam spoofing
- Fullscreen bypass
- Anti-keylogger injection
- Virtual machine evasion
- System monitoring overrides

This tool is built in **Python, Java, C++, and Rust** to demonstrate how such bypass utilities might look across various programming languages.
